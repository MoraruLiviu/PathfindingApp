## Bachelor Thesis Project at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Informatics

This aplication contains a Unity project that implements a maze generator and aims to ilustrate a practical comparison between various pathfinding algorithms in such a maze. After running each of the algorithms using their designated buttons an animation is played that exemplifies how each decides what cells to visit next as well as show the time it took for each to finish their runtime. For no animation the "Inst" button can be pressed so graphics are instant.
