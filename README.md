# PathfindingApp

## Bachelor Thesis Project at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Informatics

This aplication contains a Unity project that implements a maze generator and aims to ilustrate a practical comparison between various pathfinding algorithms in such a maze. After running each of the algorithms using their designated buttons a slow animation is played that exemplifies how each decides what cells to visit next as well as show the time it took for each to finish their runtime.
